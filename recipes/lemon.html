  <p>These lemon garlic butter chicken spiedini air-fried crispy, golden breaded chicken skewers with a light lemon garlic butter drizzle.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
  <li>1/4 cup white wine, such as Pinot Grigio</li>
  <li>3 tablespoons lemon juice, divided</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest</li>
  <li>4 cloves garlic, finely minced, divided</li>
  <li>1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
</ul>
  <h3>steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Step 1: Whisk together olive oil, wine, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, lemon zest, 1/2 of the garlic, crushed red pepper, oregano, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a bowl. Add chicken and toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate 30 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
    <li>Step 2: Stir together remaining salt and pepper with bread crumbs, panko, Parmesan cheese, and garlic powder in a shallow dish. Remove chicken from marinade and toss to coat in breadcrumb mixture, pressing to adhere as necessary. Thread chicken onto skewers and coat with olive oil cooking spray.</li>
    <li>Step 3: Preheat an air fryer to 390 degrees F (198 degrees C).  Air fry until chicken is no longer pink at the center and juices run clear, and is until lightly golden brown and crisp, about 12 minutes. An instant read thermometer, inserted near the center, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Step 4: Meanwhile, melt butter with remaining garlic in a microwave-safe dish on High in the microwave, about 10 seconds.  Stir in remaining lemon juice and parsley. Drizzle butter mixture over chicken just before serving.</li>
